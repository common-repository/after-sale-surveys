== DESCRIPTION ==

**VISIT OUR WEBSITE:** [WooCommerce Advanced Coupons](https://advancedcouponsplugin.com/?utm_source=WordPressOrg&utm_medium=ASSPlugin&utm_campaign=PluginListing)

**AFTER SALE SURVEYS FOR WOOCOMMERCE (FREE EDITION)**

A plugin to enable surveys for WooCommerce. After Sale Surveys gives WooCommerce store owners the ability to show quick popup surveys to customers after their purchase.

We've made surveying your customers as simple as it should be:

1. Install & activate the After Sale Surveys for WooCommerce plugin
1. Setup a survey under WooCommerce->After Sale Surveys
1. See individual responses under WooCommerce->Survey Responses
1. Gain insights with new survey reports under WooCommerce->Reports, Survey Responses tab

Some features at a glance:

**MULTI-CHOICE QUESTIONS**

Create your survey and setup as many multi-choice questions as you like. More question types available in the Premium version.

**PRE-SURVEY CALL-TO-ACTION**

Add some explainer text about why you are conducting your survey and ask customers for a few seconds of their time.

Most surveys of a few questions long only take 30 seconds to fill out and customers will love the opportunity to give back.

**CUSTOM THANK YOU MESSAGES**

Once your customers have completed the survey, you can thank them with an easily configurable custom thank you message.

This is a great place to add little extras like coupon codes for their next order or links to other items.

**BACKEND REPORTS**

Gain unique high-level insights with your survey responses.

Spot customer trends, alter your store, and introduce new products based on real customer feedback.

**WORKS OUT OF THE BOX**

No funny scripts or templates to setup. It just works straight out of the box with WooCommerce and will work with most themes.

We're also constantly testing new themes and plugin combinations to ensure maximum compatibility.
